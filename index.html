            <p>Our Organization has begun its Emergency COVID-19 campaign to fight against Coronavirus to the most vulnerable people in Bangladesh: the poor, disabled, jobless, hungry, elderly, and orphans. We are attempting to distribute food among 500,000 people. We are all completely acknowledged about the poor socio-economic condition of Bangladesh.COVID-19 has made the situation even worse by putting an already poverty stricken population on lockdown where accessibility to nutritional food, drinking water, products which are necessary to maintain hygienic life-style, medicines and other daily commodities are scarcer day by day. This project is addressing to cope up with the emergency need with distribution of survival kits to thousands of people who need it most.</p>
